A novel writer for Google Docs. Get ready to write for NaNoWriMo 2018 with Spooke, a free book and chapter organizer.

## Description in Google Store
There are so many options out there for writing, but Google Docs are by far the easiest -- as long as you have an internet connection, you can access your document on mobile, desktop, or tablet. But large Google Docs are slow to load and difficult to manipulate, which means that writing a book in Google Docs can be extremely annoying.

Enter Spooke. Spooke is, at its heart, simply a folder and document organizer. You use Spooke by opening the sidebar while you're in a blank document. From there, you can create a new book (it's a folder), create a new chapter (it's a GDoc), and write to your heart's content. 

Spooke operates within a single document, but affects the contents of documents in a project folder. There's no weird, abitrary,  or secretive file format. Every chapter is a Google Doc, and they're all found in your "Spooke" folder, which will be directly in your drive. 

Future updates of Spooke will include things like character templates, name generators, how-to advice, book stats, and compiling options. But for now, there's enough for you to get started writing your book!
